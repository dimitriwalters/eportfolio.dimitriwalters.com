        <h6>Job Applications and Interviewing</h6>
        <p>As a co-op student at the University of Waterloo, I had the lucky opportunity of going through the process of applying for jobs and being interviewed every other school term. From this experience, I gained a lot of knowledge on how to write an effective resume and have a good interview.</p>
        <p>Among all the resume tips I learned, the one that has changed the way I write resumes is what I learned about bullet points. Every area of a resume but the bullet points does not have much choice into how to write it. A bullet point is where there is a lot of freedom - which leaves room for mistakes. There are four components to integrate into a bullet point, those points are as follow[1]:</p>
        <p>1. Skill: what action you took</p>
        <p>2. Task: ways in which you applied skills</p>
        <p>3. Tools: how you performed the task</p>
        <p>4. Result: what outcome you achieved</p>
        <p>Along with resume writing, I also had a chance to improve my interview skills using several interview tips. One of most popular interview question is "tell me about yourself". After having had many chances to answer this, the method I have seen that works is the PAWS model[2]. It stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. The idea is to first mention how one has become interested in the field of the position. Then, talk about educational background. Move on to work experience, and end off or incorporate into the previous component the skills one has related to the position.</p>
        <p>I also learned of the importance of first impression. Interviewers actually decide whether to hire someone in the first five and a half minutes according to research[2]. It is important to start the interview on the right foot. This is achieved by greeting each interviewer as you walk in. In addition, while shaking their hands make eye contact and have a firm grip.</p>

        <h6>Networking and Mentoring</h6>
        <p>I learned a lot about the art of networking as my time as a student. One of best opportunities that I learned how to properly network was during a networking night with alumni from the University of Waterloo Arts program. This event was hosted by the University of Waterloo, and was a mandatory event that students enrolled in ARBUS 300 must attend.</p>
        <p>I was able to learn quite a bit form this experience. One of the most important concepts I learned about effective networking - and communication in general - is the proportion of the conversation I should be contributing to. Ideally, I should not be contributing more to the conversation than the person I am networking. I want them to do all the talking. But at the same time, I should contribute just enough to still show interest and not make it seem like a one-sided conversation. According to best selling author Ramit Sethi, a good rule of thumb to follow if is for a thirty-minute conversation, twenty-five minutes should be about the person I am talking to, and five should be about me[1].</p>
        <p>After the networking night was over, I emailed a few alumni to show my appreciation of them coming out and giving advice to us students. I was able to learn something really important about following-up from networking events. Ramit Sethi explains it best, "A [person you network with] wants to know that you listened to [their] advice and actually followed through"[2]. People like knowing they were helpful, it is not just important to thank them for their time. Taking the time to explain how they helped will really brighten their day and make them feel good.</p>

        <h6>Team Dynamics</h6>
        <p>Working well in a team is an important asset to have. I have improved how I work in a team thanks to understanding team dynamics. An example of where I worked in a team and learned about team dynamics was during a group in-class assignment. We were to get in a group of five, and construct a tower using twenty spaghetti sticks, one yard of tape, one yard of string, a marshmallow, and have to put the marshmallow on top. This is more popularly known as the Marshmallow Challenge.</p>
        <p>From this activity, I learned of the stages of team development. This was a theory developed by Psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965, that says there are four stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing[1]. These stages of team development were something that I can recall happening in our activity. In the forming stage, team members are positive and polite - which was the case for our team. In the storming stage, this is where conflicts start to arise as different working styles start to clash, the task starts to feel overwhelming, or team members question the worth of team's goals. This was indeed the case in our team. After we started, I started to feel overwhelm by the activity. I stopped viewing it as something fun, and started questioning the purpose of this activity. The next stage is norming, where conflicts start to resolve, team members get to know each better, and their is a stronger commitment to the team goal. This was the case for our team and me as well. I stopped being overwhelmed by the situation, and started to help my team reach our goal. The last stage is performing, where hard work is done without any disruption. This was eventually the last stage of development for our team as well. From this experience, it became clear the different stages that a team go through before eventually being in-sync.</p>
        <p>Along with the stages of a team, this experience also showed me the different roles of a team. There are three categories of team member’s roles: task roles, maintenance roles, and dysfunctional roles. Task roles are roles that focus directly on the task that the team is performing. This is in contrast of indirect roles, which help the team in ways other than something related to the task. Examples of task roles are initiator, information seeker, devil's advocate, and recorder. Maintenance roles are roles that do not directly relate to the task, but help the team in other ways. Examples of these roles are encourager, harmonizer, and compromiser. The last groups of roles are dysfunctional roles. These roles disrupt the team. Examples of such roles are aggressors, blockers, and clowns. What I noticed in our group was that I was an information seeker and clarifier. An information seeker asks for facts and ideas relating to the performing of the task, and a clarifier sums up the consensus and progress[1]. From this experience, I could now pinpoint what roles team members in a team are playing. By understanding this team dynamic, I could better shift my role in a team if I know our team needs a certain role.</p>
