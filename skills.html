        <h6>Job Applications and Interviewing</h6>
        <p>As a co-op student at the University of Waterloo, I had the lucky opportunity of going through the process of applying for jobs and being interviewed every other school term. From this experience, I gained a lot of knowledge on how to write an effective resume and have a good interview.</p>
        <p>Among all the resume tips I learned, the one that has changed the way I write resumes is what I learned about bullet points. Every area of a resume but the bullet points does not have much choice into how to write it. A bullet point is where there is a lot of freedom - which leaves room for mistakes. There are four components to integrate into a bullet point, those points are as follow[1]:</p>
        <p>1. Skill: what action you took</p>
        <p>2. Task: ways in which you applied skills</p>
        <p>3. Tools: how you performed the task</p>
        <p>4. Result: what outcome you achieved</p>
        <p>Along with resume writing, I also had a chance to improve my interview skills using several interview tips. One of most popular interview question is "tell me about yourself". After having had many chances to answer this, the method I have seen that works is the PAWS model[2]. It stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. The idea is to first mention how one has become interested in the field of the position. Then, talk about educational background. Move on to work experience, and end off or incorporate into the previous component the skills one has related to the position.</p>
        <p>I also learned of the importance of first impression. Interviewers actually decide whether to hire someone in the first five and a half minutes according to research[2]. It is important to start the interview on the right foot. This is achieved by greeting each interviewer as you walk in. In addition, while shaking their hands make eye contact and have a firm grip.</p>
