        <p class="lead">Me, my hobbies, my life</p>

        <p>I am a Computer Science student, graphic designer, and web developer. I am currently in my second-year of Computer Science, enrolled in the Co-operative Program at the University of Waterloo. I first started graphic designing when I was twelve, designing small artwork such as signatures and avatars for message boards. My first taste in the world of web development was from courses and tutorials online, and I further expanded my knowledge by developing my website and other personal projects.</p>

        <h6 class="about-subheading">Gaming</h6>

        <p>I had many hobbies as a child, but none of those hobbies has had an enormous impact on my life as much as gaming has. Video games seems to receive a terrible reputation as a negative influence on children. And this is partially correct, but only correct in the same manner that any hobby can have a negative influence on someone. For me specifically, video games ended up having a positive influence on me.</p>

        <p>One thing that distinguishes me form most people is my quick mind, and this is mostly thanks to video games. From a young age I would play intense video games that requires a quick mind to play. It is because of this that my mind developed to what it is today. This ended up being a good thing, as being a software developer and Math student requires a quick mind. I probably would not be studying Computer Science if it was not for playing video games all the time.</p>

        <p>Besides the influence video games has had in my life, it was also just something I really enjoyed. Whether or not it did influence my university career, I cannot discuss my life without mentioning such a large part of my childhood. I discussed how I played video games at a very young age, but I also played it well beyond those years. For the majority of my life, I would play video games every chance I got.</p>

        <p>As of today, I do not play video games much. However, I do have a Ninetndo Wii hooked up in my room, but I only get a chance to play it on holidays or when I am really stressed out by school and need a way to relax. But even if it was not for school occupying my time, I would not continue to play video games as I use to do. There are more important goals in my life that I dream of fulfilling. But I do cherish the impact video games has had on my life.</p>

        <h6 class="about-subheading">GFX</h6>

        <p>When I was about twelve, I discovered a magical universe known as the internet. I spent my time browsing the internet randomly, and I eventually discovered the world of graphic designing (also known as GFX). I first discovered it after wanting to have a good avatar and design for the message board I used to go on. I soon discovered message boards and websites completely devoted for small graphic artwork life avatars and signatures, and soon my interest was in designing itself.</p>

        <p>For a few years of my life, I spent all my time designing art. I sadly deleted most of the artworks I created, out of frustration that it looked hideous when viewing it years later. But I still have a few pieces of designs that I have not deleted, which are the designs that I am still proud of or have meant a lot to me.</p>

        <p>Like video games, graphic designing also influenced my life. Not only did it improve my eye for design, but it also had a factor in my career choice. It was my passion for beautiful designs that made me passionate about front-end web development. I enjoy developing software, but I also enjoy designing beautiful artworks. A career in web development (front-end web development to be specific) allows me to combine both of these aspects.</p>

        <h6 class="about-subheading">Software</h6>

        <p>I first learned about software development from a course I took in high school. Up until this point, I did not know what to do as a career. I knew I was good in Math, but I did not know how to apply these skills in a career. After taking this course, I thought this was a good use of my skills and decided to pursue a career in software. But as I continued along this career path in software development, I discovered more reasons for why I belong in this field.</p>

        <p>I enjoy problem solving. This can be seen in my love for video games and success in Math. And it is for this reason that a career in software development is perfect for me. A career where I have to repeat the same task everyday does not excite me. I enjoy having to constantly solve new problems everyday, and no other career demands this as much as being a software developer. Technology is becoming more advanced everyday, and the tools used to build software is constantly changing. For this reason, software developers have to be continually learning and problem solving in their career. And it is this aspect of software development that I enjoy. Dealing with new problems and learning everyday is what keeps me engaged to work.</p>

        <p>As for the rest of this chapter...it is still being written today! I am working on projects everyday for personal use and learning. I am also learning more about the world of software through my university's well-designed courses, and from co-op/work experiences. And only time can predict what else the future holds.</p>
