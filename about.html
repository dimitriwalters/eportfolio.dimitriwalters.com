        <p class="lead">Summary of my professional life</p>

        <p>I am a third-year student at the University of Waterloo enrolled in the Computer Science/Software Engineering Option, Honours, Co-operative Program with a Management Studies Minor.</p>

        <p>Ever since I first learned about programming in high school, I have been interested in a career in software. I have been drawn to math since I was young - which I commonly associate with growing up playing video games - and programming was the real first practical chance I got to use my interest in math in a meaningful way. I ended up taking all the successive programming courses my high school had to offer, which has lead me to where I am now.</p>

        <p>I was fortunate enough to be enrolled in the co-operative program at my university, where I would spend six terms of my undergraduate employed at a company. I have gained a tremendous amount of experience from these placements. I have had three work terms so far, the positions being as a Front-end Web Developer, a Java Developer, and a Node.js Developer.</p>

        <p>Along with my experience as a co-op student, I have done quite a bit of programming on the side. I have completed several freelance projects developing web applications and websites. I also have a ton of software projects that I worked on - ranging from simple web applications, programs testing a new technology, or libraries and packages that I have published online.</p>

        <p>If you would like to get more information about me, feel free to contact me through the various tools I listed on my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
